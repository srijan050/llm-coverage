- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports ("read_A" and "read_B") and a write port ("write")
    - "read_A" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - "read_B" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - "write" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.
